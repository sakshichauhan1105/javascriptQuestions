# JavaScript Conditional Statements Quiz Questions

This repository contains a series of JavaScript quiz questions with detailed explanations of the expected outputs. It is designed to help developers improve their JavaScript knowledge and understanding of key concepts like comparison operators, conditional logic, truthy/falsy values, and more.


## Questions

### 1. What will the following code output?

```javascript
let x = 10;
if (x = 5) {
    console.log("Equal");
} else {
    console.log("Not Equal");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Equal"  
  **Explanation:** The code uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`. The value `5` is assigned to `x`, which is truthy, so the `if` block executes.
</details>

---

### 2. What will be the output of this code?

```javascript
let a = 0;
if (a) {
    console.log("True");
} else {
    console.log("False");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "False"  
  **Explanation:** The value `0` is falsy in JavaScript, so the `else` block executes.
</details>

---

### 3. What will be printed when the following code is executed?

```javascript
let b = null;
if (b == undefined) {
    console.log("Matched");
} else {
    console.log("Not Matched");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Matched"  
  **Explanation:** The `==` operator checks for equality with type coercion. `null` and `undefined` are considered equal when using loose equality.
</details>

---

### 4. What will the output be?

```javascript
let c = "5";
if (c === 5) {
    console.log("Strictly Equal");
} else {
    console.log("Not Strictly Equal");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Not Strictly Equal"  
  **Explanation:** The `===` operator checks both value and type. Since `c` is a string and `5` is a number, they are not strictly equal.
</details>

---

### 5. What will this code return?

```javascript
let d = 10;
if (d > 5 && d < 15) {
    console.log("In Range");
} else {
    console.log("Out of Range");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "In Range"  
  **Explanation:** Both conditions (`d > 5` and `d < 15`) are true, so the first block executes.
</details>

---

### 6. What will be the output of the following?

```javascript
let e = 10;
if (e > 5 || e < 5) {
    console.log("Condition Met");
} else {
    console.log("Condition Not Met");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Condition Met"  
  **Explanation:** The `||` operator checks if at least one condition is true. Since `e > 5` is true, the first block executes.
</details>

---

### 7. What will this code print?

```javascript
let f = 0;
if (f) {
    console.log("Truthy");
} else if (f === 0) {
    console.log("Falsy Zero");
} else {
    console.log("Default");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Falsy Zero"  
  **Explanation:** The first condition is false because `0` is falsy. The second condition checks if `f` is strictly equal to `0`, which is true, so this block executes.
</details>

---

### 8. What is the output of this code?

```javascript
let g = "Hello";
if (g.length > 5) {
    console.log("Long String");
} else {
    console.log("Short String");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Short String"  
  **Explanation:** The length of the string `"Hello"` is 5, which is not greater than 5, so the else block executes.
</details>

---

### 9. What will this code output?

```javascript
let h = "0";
if (h) {
    console.log("Truthy");
} else {
    console.log("Falsy");
}
```

let i = NaN;
if (i) {
    console.log("Not NaN");
} else {
    console.log("Is NaN");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Is NaN"  
  **Explanation:** `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is falsy in JavaScript, so the `else` block executes.
</details>

---

### 11. What will this code return?

```javascript
let j = "false";
if (j) {
    console.log("Truthy");
} else {
    console.log("Falsy");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Truthy"  
  **Explanation:** The string `"false"` is non-empty and thus truthy.
</details>

if (l === null) {
    console.log("Null");
} else {
    console.log("Not Null");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Not Null"  
  **Explanation:** `undefined` is not strictly equal to `null`, so the `else` block executes.
</details>

---

### 14. What will the following code print?

```javascript
let m = "10";
if (m == 10) {
    console.log("Loose Equality");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "Loose Equality"  
  **Explanation:** The `==` operator performs type coercion, so the string `"10"` is converted to a number for comparison, resulting in equality.
</details>

---

### 15. What will be the output of this code?

```javascript
let n = "2";
if (n + 2 == 4) {
    console.log("True");
} else {
    console.log("False");
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Click to view Answer and Explanation</summary>
  **Answer:** "False"  
  **Explanation:** The expression `n + 2` results in the string `"22"` due to string concatenation. When using `==`, the string is coerced to a number and compared to `4`, which results in false.
</details>

---

### 16. What will the following code output?

```javascript
let o = 1;
if (o) {
    console.log("One");
